I made a reactions component in SvelteKit that uses Upstash Redis to
store the user reactions. It uses a SvelteKit form action to submit
the reaction to the server. It's a nice example of how to use Upstash
with SvelteKit.

I'll go through creating the project so you can follow along if you
like or you can Tl;Dr and go to the [example](#example) if you like

## Create the Upstash Redis Database

Upstash make it really straightforward to create a Redis database.

Go to https://console.upstash.com/login and create an account if you
don't have one already.

In the Redis databases section I'll click on the 'Create Database'
button. I'm them prompted to give the database a name, I'll call it
`sveltekit-reactions`.

For the type I can choose between 'Global' or 'Regional'. I'll go with
the default 'Global' option.

The primary region I'll go with where the project will be built which
will eventually be on Vercel so I'll go with `us-west-2`. For the read
region I'll go with `us-west-1`.

I'll leave the rest of the options as the default and click the
'Create' button.

Take note of the 'REST API' section here, I'll need the
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and the ` UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to go
into the `.env` file in the project.

Which brings me to the next step.

## Create the SvelteKit Project

Aight! Now I can scaffold out the SvelteKit project. I'll add in the
terminal commands if you want to follow along, I'll kick off the
SvelteKit CLI with the `pnpm create` command.

```bash
pnpm create svelte sveltekit-reactions
```

I'll pick the following options:

```text
create-svelte version 5.0.2

‚îå  Welcome to SvelteKit!
‚îÇ
‚óÜ  Which Svelte app template?
‚îÇ  Skeleton project
‚îÇ
‚óÜ  Add type checking with TypeScript?
‚îÇ  Yes, using TypeScript syntax
‚îÇ
‚óÜ  Select additional options (use arrow keys/space bar)
‚îÇ  ‚óº Add ESLint for code linting
‚îÇ  ‚óº Add Prettier for code formatting
‚îÇ  ‚óº Add Playwright for browser testing
‚îÇ  ‚óº Add Vitest for unit testing
‚îî
```

Then change directory into the project and install the dependencies I
need, right now I'll install `@upstash/redis` and `@upstash/ratelimit`
as dev dependencies.

```bash
cd sveltekit-reactions
pnpm i -D @upstash/redis @upstash/ratelimit
```

So I'm not messing around with styling I'll install Tailwind CSS with
the daisyUI and Tailwind typography plugins with `svelte-add`.

```bash
npx svelte-add@latest tailwindcss --daisyui --typography
# install configured dependencies
pnpm i
```

Now a quick check to see if everything is working as expected.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Sweet! So, now onto creating the form component with the reactions.

## Create the Reactions Component

I'll create the folders and files I need now for the project. First,
the reactions component which I'm going to put in the
`src/lib/components` directory. The `-p` flag will create the parent
directory if it doesn't exist.

Then create additional files for configuring the component, a utils
file for re-useable functions and another file for the Upstash Redis
client.

I'll do that with the following commands.

```bash
# make the components lib directory
mkdir src/lib/components -p
# make the reactions component
touch src/lib/components/reactions.svelte
touch src/lib/{config,redis,utils}.ts
# add the page server file fo the form action
touch src/routes/+page.server.ts
```

The component will be a form that will submit the reaction to the
server via a SvelteKit form action.

I'll scaffold out the component first then move onto the form action.

Rather than have a predefined set of reactions I'll make it so that
the user can add their own reactions in the `src/lib/config.ts` file.

```ts
export const reactions = [
  { type: 'likes', emoji: 'üëç' },
  { type: 'hearts', emoji: '‚ù§Ô∏è' },
  { type: 'poops', emoji: 'üí©' },
  { type: 'parties', emoji: 'üéâ' },
]
```

Then in the `src/lib/components/reactions.svelte` file I'll import the
reactions from the config file and use them in the component.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { reactions } from '$lib/config'
</script>

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <form
    method="POST"
    class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-5 sm:flex"
  >
    {#each reactions as reaction}
      <button
        name="reaction"
        type="submit"
        value={reaction.type}
        class="btn btn-primary shadow-xl text-3xl font-bold"
      >
        <span>
          {reaction.emoji}
        </span>
      </button>
    {/each}
  </form>
</div>
```

I've added some Tailwind and daisyUI classes to the form for some
basic styling.

So, for now I just want to render out the emoji reaction as I've not
wired up the count from redis yet.

I have added a `POST` method to the form and a `name` and `type`
attribute to the button. This will be used in the form action to get
the value of the button that was clicked.

If I click one of the buttons now I get a `405` error telling me that
a `POST` method is not allowed as there are no actions for the page.

I'll create the form action next.

## Create the Form Action

Now I want to get the forma action working so I can get the value of
the button that was clicked and send it to the server.

In the `src/routes/+page.server.ts` file I'll add in an actions
object, in this case I'm going to need only the default action.

In the default action I'll need the form data which will be `name` and
`value` of the button that was clicked and I'll get the `reaction` out
of the `data` object.

The last thing I'll need is the `path` which will be the page the
component is on. The prop for this isn't in the component yet so I'll
need to add that in.

For now I want to validate the action is working so I'll just log out
the data to the console.

```ts
export const actions = {
  default: async ({ request, url }) => {
    const data = await request.formData()
    const reaction = data.get('reaction')
    const path = url.searchParams.get('path')

    console.log('=====================')
    console.log(data)
    console.log(reaction)
    console.log(path)
    console.log('=====================')
    return {}
  },
}

export const load = async () => {
  return {}
}
```

## Example

Ok, I've gone through the steps to create this component. If you just
want to check out the example of the source code you can see the
[example repo on GitHub] and the [live demo].

## Thanks

Thanks to Jamie Barton for giving me the idea for this component where
he does something similar with [Grafbase]. There's also the [Upstash
claps] repo which is a Next.js example.

Thanks to [Geoff Rich] for his great posts on rate limiting with Redis
and SvelteKit on the [Upstash blog].
