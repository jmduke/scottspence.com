Ok, I don't usually do a post like this, this site is usually around
how to work with a technology or to get something done with it.

This time around it's more of a starter pack on where to start if you
want to take back some control over your online experience and
privacy.

I'm no privacy expert, these are some steps I have taken to reduce the
amount of data I give to big companies.

First though, preamble!

## The problem

"Look at these suckers paying for email!" Yeah, I used to think like
that too. When you're using a "free" service, it feels like you're
gaming the system – getting something for nothing while others pay for
premium features. But here's the rub: these services aren't free.
You're paying in a different currency – your personal data, your
attention and your digital autonomy.

Chrome's recent move to manifest v3 meaning ad blockers will cease to
be as effective is the perfect example of how "free" services (like
YouTube) eventually degrade so much that you pay for premium features.

Google search becoming worse over time so you use it more and see more
and more sponsored links.

## "But I have nothing to hide"

Whenever privacy comes up in conversation, someone inevitably says, "I
have nothing to hide." But this misses the point entirely. Privacy
isn't about hiding dark secrets – it's about maintaining control over
your digital life.

Another common response is "they know everything about me already."
People don't like change, I get it, but the "this is how I've always
done it, why should I change?" is what big tech companies depend on.

## Practical steps to digital independence

Here's a few services I have been using with a high level overview of
why I chose them.

## Email: Fastmail

After using Gmail for years, I made the switch to Fastmail in 2021.
The killer feature? (for me) Masked emails. Integrated with 1Password,
I can create a unique email address for every service I sign up for.
When a service gets compromised or starts spamming, I can simply
disable that specific address without affecting my main email.

I had a short stint with ProtonMail and Zoho mail, more on that in
[Why Fastmail over Proton Mail](https://scottspence.com/posts/why-fastmail-over-proton-mail)

## Analytics: Fathom

Google analytics, free yay! Well, what do you think they are doing
with all that data they're slurping up from your site's users?

As a developer, I need analytics to understand how people use my
websites. But that doesn't mean I need to track them across the web.
Fathom Analytics provides the insights I need while respecting user
privacy. No cookie banners required, no personal data collected. It's
proof that you can have useful analytics without surveillance.

## Search: Kagi

I switched to Kagi because, simply put, it gives me better search
results than Google. While DuckDuckGo offers a good free
privacy-focused alternative, I personally find Kagi's results more
relevant for my needs. Since they're not driven by an ad-based
business model, the results feel more neutral - you get what matches
your search, not what someone paid to rank for. For me, that's worth
paying for.

## VPN: Mullvad

I was previously using Mozilla VPN, but switched to Mullvad because of
it's privacy focus, not that Mozilla wasn't the Mullvad VPN is
completely anonymous in how you set up and use the service, no email
or payment details on file, just a ID number.

## Making informed choices

So these are choices I have made, you do you. Do your own research and
make your own choices that make sense for you. How do you know which
services to trust though? This is where independent tech journalism
comes in.

## The rise of independent tech journalism

There's been an increase in independent journalist like 404 media, and
podcast like Grumpy old Geeks, and Better Offline that don't idolise
these companies and instead cut through that because the're not afraid
of losing access to a CEO if they ask the hard questions.

This kind of independent journalism doesn't just help us stay
informed - it helps us make better choices about the tools and
services we use. When you understand how your data is being used (or
misused), those paid privacy-focused alternatives start looking less
like an expense and more like an investment in your digital autonomy.

## Building a better web

But what can I do? The indie web isn't just a throwback to the "old
internet" – it's the future. As AI-generated content floods the
mainstream web, human-created content on independent platforms becomes
more valuable than ever.

RSS feeds might seem old-school, but they offer something precious:
the ability to curate your own information diet. Instead of letting
algorithms decide what you should see, you choose your sources and
consume content on your own terms.

## A call to action

Change is hard. Most people use the internet with specific objectives
in mind, and completely changing their digital habits feels daunting.
But you don't have to do everything at once. Start small:

1. Pick one service to replace with a privacy-respecting alternative
2. Set up an RSS reader and subscribe to some independent blogs
3. Question whether "free" services are really serving your needs

Remember: if you're not paying for the product, you are the product.
But the good news is that there are increasingly more options for
those willing to pay for services that respect their privacy.

The web we want still exists – we just have to be willing to support
it.
