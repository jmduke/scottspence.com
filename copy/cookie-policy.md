Oi, Let's 'ave a Chat 'Bout Cookies, Shall We?

Alright, on [scottspence.com](), I'm not all about the fuss, but
there's a thing or two you should know about cookies when you're
nipping around my site.

### So, what are these cookie things anyway?

Imagine cookies as tiny text notes my website jots down on your device
when you swing by. They help the site remember your bits and bobs like
language, theme, and such, so you ain't got to bother with it every
time you drop in. Handy, innit?

### How am I using them?

Now, I'm keeping it simple, just how I like it. I'll only use a single
cookie on [scottspence.com](), and here's what it's for:

### Theme selection cookie:

- **Name**: theme
- **Job**: This cookie remembers your theme choice on my site. So,
  every time you pop by, your favourite look is ready and waiting.
- **Shelf-life**: A year. If you don't visit again in that time it
  will expire.
- **Type**: First-party cookie. Only for this site used nowhere else
  or shared.

I donâ€™t use cookies for ads or following you around the internet. I
respect your privacy. For more on that check out the
[Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).

### Your choices about cookies

You're the boss of your cookies. You can tell your browser to accept
my cookie, or tell me to do one!

Want to know more about managing your cookies? Check out these guides:

- [Google Chrome]
- [Mozilla Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge]
- [Apple Safari]

### Cookie Policy Updates

I might tweak this Cookie Policy now and again. If I do, you'll find
the new version here, and I'll update the "Last Updated" date for you.

### Got Questions?
