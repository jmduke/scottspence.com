Ok, cookies! All you need to know about how they are being used on
this site. **Tl;Dr**: You're not being tracked, so no need to worry. I
slap one on here for theme selection.

### So, what are these cookie things anyway?

Imagine cookies as tiny text notes my website jots down on your device
when you swing by. They help the site remember your bits and bobs like
language, theme, and such, so you ain't got to bother with it every
time you drop in. Handy, innit?

### How am I using them?

If you noticed the theme selector, where you can play around with the
themes on the site, that's using a cookie.

### Theme selection cookie:

- **Name**: theme
- **Job**: This cookie remembers your theme choice on my site. So,
  every time you pop by, your favourite look is ready and waiting.
- **Shelf-life**: A year. If you don't visit again in that time it
  will expire.
- **Type**: First-party cookie. Only for this site used nowhere else
  or shared.

I donâ€™t use cookies for selling ads or following you around the
internet. I respect your privacy. For more on that check out the
[Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).

### Your choices about cookies

You're the boss of your cookies. You can tell your browser to accept
my cookie, or tell me to do one!

### Cookie Policy Updates

I might tweak this Cookie Policy now and again. If I do, you'll find
the new version here, and I'll update the "Last Updated" date for you.
