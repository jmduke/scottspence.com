Hello ðŸ‘‹, I've probably sent you this link in response to your email.

If your email included phrases like:

- "I was browsing your website and found it very informative"
- "I have some high-quality content that would be perfect"
- "Would love to collaborate/partner with you"
- "I can offer you a guest post in exchange for..."
- "I think your audience would find this resource valuable"

Then this page is for you.

## What this actually is

Let's be clear about what you're requesting. You want to place links
on my site to boost your search rankings. That's advertising, not a
partnership or collaboration.

I only link to resources I genuinely use and can recommend to my
readers. My credibility with my audience is built on this trust, and
you're essentially asking me to sell that credibility.

## If you're serious about advertising

Here are my non-negotiable commercial terms for sponsored content:

**Link placement in existing articles:** Â£30,000 per link per month

**Sponsored article creation:** Â£45,000 per article per month

**Requirements:**

- Pre-payment via bank transfer only
- All sponsored links marked clearly as advertising
- `rel="nofollow"` attribute on all paid links
- No implied endorsement of products or services
- Content must be relevant to web development

**Process:**

- Email me referencing this page
- Include "I accept these advertising terms" in your email
- Provide invoice details and specify exact placement requirements
- Payment required before any work begins

## Why these rates?

My site attracts senior developers, engineering leaders, and
decision-makers in the web development space.

These rates reflect:

- The actual cost of potentially damaging my credibility with my
  audience
- The risk to my site's search rankings from low-quality link
  associations
- The time required to properly vet content and ensure it serves my
  readers

Google's algorithms penalise sites that participate in link schemes.
Adding your links without proper disclosure and `nofollow` attributes
could harm my search rankings. If you can't afford these rates, you
can't afford to advertise here.

## What genuine partnerships look like

Real collaboration involves mutual benefit, shared audiences, and
content that genuinely serves both communities. It doesn't start with
a template email about how my content "would be perfect" for a link
insertion.

If you're genuinely interested in technical collaboration, developer
education, or supporting the Svelte community,
[get in touch](/contact) with what you're actually building.

## Thanks for reading

Now you know where I stand. If these terms work for you, brilliant. If
not, I completely understand - there are plenty of other sites that
might be a better fit for your budget.
