In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, having a seasoned expert
on your team can be the difference between success and stagnation.
With nearly two decades of diverse tech experience, I bring a unique
blend of technical prowess, leadership skills, and community influence
to the table.

## What can an expert Svelte and SvelteKit Developer Advocate do for you?

With <DD date='2004-06-15' /> of experience in the tech industry,
including <DD date='2016-06-15' /> of hands-on web and fullstack
development, I offer more than just coding skills. My proficiency lies
in empowering teams, driving adoption, and elevating products through
education, advocacy, and strategic guidance.

With my diverse background I have honed my skills in stakeholder
management and realistic project management, which I've successfully
applied throughout my career. This unique combination allows me to
bridge the gap between technical implementation and business needs
effectively.

As a Svelte ambassador and co-founder of the Svelte Society London
events for nearly 3 years, I serve as a bridge between your team and
the broader Svelte community. This proactive approach can
significantly boost your product's adoption, visibility, and success.

Whether it's delivering top-tier workshops, leading projects, or
advocating for your product, my diverse skill set can drive tangible
results for your team and business.

## Workshops & speaking engagements

_**Empowering developers through education**_

With <DD date='2021-04-21' /> of experience delivering engaging talks
at events like JSNation, CityJS, Connect.Tech Atlanta, and Jamstack
Conf, I've honed my skills in translating complex technical concepts
into actionable learning experiences. My workshops aim to empower
developers, providing them with the tools and knowledge to navigate
and utilize Svelte and SvelteKit effectively.

From beginner-friendly introductions to advanced deep dives, I offer
workshops that cater to all experience levels. Participants walk away
with a comprehensive understanding of these powerful tools and the
ability to implement them effectively in their own projects.

## Consulting & project delivery

_**Bringing expert knowledge and leadership to your team**_

Beyond standalone workshops, I offer long-term consulting services and
project leadership. As the current Application Team Lead at XtendOps,
overseeing a large SvelteKit monorepo codebase, I bring valuable
experience in leading multi-national remote teams and ensuring best
practices throughout the development lifecycle. For specialized Svelte
consulting services, visit
[Svelte Consulting](https://svelteconsulting.dev) or
[OES Technology](https://oestechnology.co.uk).

My approach is collaborative and adaptive, focusing on creating a
positive and productive working environment. I believe in the
importance of communication and transparency in ensuring a project's
success, and work with team members to foster these values.

Whether your team needs to expand its knowledge of Svelte and
SvelteKit, or require expert guidance on a major project, my wealth of
experience can be a valuable asset.

Common scenarios where I deliver successful projects:

- You need a developer advocate to increase the visibility and
  adoption of your product.
- You require assistance with workshops, tutorials, demos, educational
  videos, and blog posts for your platform.
- You need an experienced developer to create sample applications,
  prototypes, and code samples showcasing Svelte and SvelteKit with
  your product.

If any of these situations describe your needs, you're in the right
place. Let's collaborate to elevate your project to new heights.

## How much?

_**Transparency and flexibility**_

I believe in straightforward, transparent pricing. To simplify this
process, I've added pricing widgets that cover the services I offer,
all calculated on a single rate.

_**Currency preference and client location**_

While I'm based in the UK (Swanley, Kent), I've had the privilege to
work with diverse teams across different time zones. I prefer payments
in EUR or USD, aligning well with the international tech market.
However, I'm adaptable and can work with your company's local currency
if needed.

My preference leans towards forming long-lasting relationships with
international companies, valuing the dynamics of global cooperation
and the opportunities they present.

## Rates

The widget below factors in holidays (with 8 days public holidays as
default). If you're willing to provide Paid Time Off (PTO) or it's a
short contract, you can adjust using the slider. This gives you an
idea of the budget and helps align with your existing employment
practices.
