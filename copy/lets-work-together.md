  Last updated: <DateUpdated date='2023-07-31' small='true' />
</Small>

In today's tech landscape, having a specialized expert on your team
can be a game-changer. As an experienced JavaScript Developer and
Developer Advocate, I bring a unique blend of technical and
communication skills, and a deep understanding of Svelte and
SvelteKit.

You can Tl;Dr and skip straight to see [how much](#how-much) it'll
cost.

My expertise lies in empowering other developers through education,
advocacy, and guidance. I'm proficient in identifying and solving
problems, simplifying technical concepts, and translating them into
easy-to-understand terms.

As an advocate, I serve as a bridge between your team and the broader
Svelte community, helping you keep up with the latest trends, best
practices, and technological advancements. This proactive approach can
help your product's adoption, visibility, and success.

Whether it's delivering top-tier workshops, leading and consulting on
projects, or advocating for your product, my skill-set can drive
tangible results for your team and business.

## Workshops & speaking engagements

_**Empowering developers through education**_

With years of experience delivering engaging and informative talks at
events like Svelte Society London, CityJS, and Connect.Tech Atlanta, I
have honed my skills in translating complex technical concepts into
actionable learning experiences. My workshops aim to empower
developers, providing them with the tools and knowledge to navigate
and utilise Svelte and SvelteKit.

I provide workshops that cater to a variety of experience levels,
ranging from an introduction to Svelte and SvelteKit for beginners, to
deep dives into advanced topics for more experienced developers.
Participants will walk away with a comprehensive understanding of
these powerful tools, and the ability to implement them effectively in
their own projects.

## Consulting & project delivery

_**Bringing expert knowledge and leadership to your team**_

Besides offering standalone workshops, I also provide longer-term
consulting services. These can be in the form of ongoing support for
your team's projects, or I can step in as a team lead to ensure the
successful delivery of high-quality SvelteKit applications.

My approach is collaborative and adaptive, with a focus on creating a
positive and productive working environment. I believe in the
importance of communication and transparency in ensuring a projectâ€™s
success, and work with team members to foster these values.

Whether your team is looking to expand its knowledge of Svelte and
SvelteKit, or requires expert guidance on a major project, my wealth
of experience and deep understanding of these tools can be a valuable
asset.

Common scenarios where I deliver successful projects:

- You are looking for a developer advocate to help increase the
  visibility and adoption of your product.
- You need help with workshops, tutorials, demos, educational videos,
  and blog posts for your platform.
- You're looking to launch an eCommerce project using Svelte and need
  a professional to code it.
- You'd like to leverage the power of a headless CMS platform.
- You're looking for an experienced developer to create sample
  applications, prototypes, and code samples showcasing the power and
  flexibility of Svelte and SvelteKit with your product.

If one of these situations describes your needs, you're in the right
place. You can hire me to help today.

## How much?

_**Transparency and flexibility**_

I believe in straightforward, transparent pricing. After all, it's
essential to ensure we're both on the same page before we start
working together. To simplify this process, I've added some pricing
widgets that cover the services I offer.

Calculated on a single rate from which all services are derived. With
this approach you can select what fits your needs best.

_**Currency preference and client location**_

I prefer payments in EUR or USD, which aligns well with the majority
of the international tech market. But, I am adaptable and can work
with the local currency of your company's base location.

While I'm based in the UK, I've had the privilege to work with diverse
teams across different time zones. I've found that this global
approach enhances the creative process, bringing together a rich array
of ideas and perspectives.

While I'm open to UK-based projects for shorter terms, my preference
leans towards forming long-lasting relationships with international
companies. This preference comes from past experiences that has shaped
my approach to work, valuing the dynamics of international cooperation
and the opportunities they present.

_**I just want a quote!**_

The widget here factors in holiday. But, if you're willing to provide
PTO when hiring me or it's a short contract, you can remove that using
the slider. This gives you an idea of the budget and helps align with
your existing employment practices.
